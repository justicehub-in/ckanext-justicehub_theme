    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>Justice Hub was born out of the <a href="https://agami.in/d4j/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agami Data for Justice Challenge</a> in June 2019. The Challenge sought to curate a collaborative entrepreneurial effort that increases and evolves the use of data. Inputs from a wide range of changemakers, led us to see the opportunity to collaborate on each otherâ€™s datasets.</p>

    <p>
      The Challenge invited applicants to create a data hub and create new datasets, and after a rigorous selection process <a href="https://civicdatalab.in" target="_blank">CivicDataLab</a> was selected as the winner to create the Justice Hub.
